Regularly share updates, challenges, and milestones with your community to build a personal connection.\n\n5. **Engage in High-Impact Activities:** Focus on activities that offer maximum engagement for your time investment, such as hosting a monthly webinar or participating in a Q&A session.\n\n6. **Set Clear Boundaries:** Define what success looks like for your community engagement so you can stay focused and avoid getting drawn into time-consuming activities.\n\nRemember, building a community is a marathon, not a sprint.
